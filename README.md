This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It includes medical information for Pima women aged 21 and older, and its goal is to explore patterns associated with diabetes.

Step 1 Summary , Real Dataset Information

🔍 Dataset Understanding & Initial Inspection (Real Values)

Rows & Columns:
768 rows, 9 columns

Columns:
Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness,
Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome

Data Types:
All features are numeric.

Missing Values:
There are no formal NaNs, but there are biologically impossible zeros:

Glucose → 5 zeros

BloodPressure → 35 zeros

SkinThickness → 227 zeros

Insulin → 374 zeros

BMI → 11 zeros

Real Descriptive Stats:

Mean Glucose ≈ 120.9

Mean BMI ≈ 31.99

Mean Age ≈ 33.24

Max Pregnancies = 17

Target Distribution (actual):

0 → 500 samples (65.1%)

1 → 268 samples (34.9%)
→ The dataset is imbalanced.

Initial Observations:

Glucose, BMI, and Age appear to be the strongest early indicators.

Insulin contains many zeros and may need imputation.

Dataset requires cleaning before analysis.

Step 2 — Data Cleaning

🧼 1. Identifying Invalid Zero Values

Several features contained biologically impossible zeros:

Glucose → 5 zeros

BloodPressure → 35 zeros

SkinThickness → 227 zeros

Insulin → 374 zeros

BMI → 11 zeros

These were treated as invalid values.

🔧 2. Replacing Invalid Values

All invalid zeros were replaced using the median of each respective column.
Median was chosen to avoid distortion from outliers and preserve natural distribution.

After replacement:

No unrealistic zero values remained

Distributions became smoother and more reliable

🧹 3. Outlier Check

Outliers were reviewed but not aggressively removed, as EDA benefits from analyzing the natural variability of the data.

🔍 4. Final Validation

After cleaning:

No missing or invalid values remained

Dataset became ready for visualization and deeper analysis
